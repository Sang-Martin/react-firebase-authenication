# Firebase Authenication

The purpose of this project is to validate users when they log in or log out in order to access dashboard panel using firebase authenication

## What I learned

- It is helpful because when it comes to a real life, it is necessary to allow specific users to be able to access the dashboard to modify products

- Also, it is user-friendly to navigate users to the right page when they logged in successfully or not

## What I liked

- The process to validate is pretty simple

## What I didn't liked

- Still dont know how to add new user to be able to register to access the dashboard
